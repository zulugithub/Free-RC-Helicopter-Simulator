x calibration abort needed (with esc-key)
x drop-down list for some parameter in options (e.g. rotor_system_definition "Single", "Tandem", instead of "0", "1")
- tandem helicopter: Mainrotor transparency overlapping issue
- animation key "a" has to be pushed twice, if door opened, hten switch helicopter, then switch back
- add low-pass-filter to wheel-rotation if in the air, thus rolling a little bit after liftoff
x flybareless controller does not hold orianteation, if hub_stiffness_mr is small
- collision point copy ( due to concave mesh problem) should have its distance to original point define by size. of helicopter
- UI button in options opens on windows systems 'regedit', what is the code to open regdit? in macIO? 
- when skybox download finished, avoid lag in game
- governor reenable inside e.g. 10sec after turn off with faster speed
x add installer
- phyiscs 
	- vortex ring state
	- turbulences
	- ground effect
	- autorotation
	- wing equations (lookup tabel HFEHeli..)
	- thrust limit / stall
	- in fast forward flight flapping up
	- gyroscopic rotor effects  	http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:821251/FULLTEXT01.pdf
	- inertial counter torque ?? 	http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:821251/FULLTEXT01.pdf
- hud
	- show if rotation velocity is limited by controller's K_a factor oder by physics?
	- show stall
